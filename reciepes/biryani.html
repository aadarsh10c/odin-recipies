    <p>Who doesn't love a plate of flavourful Biryani? Biryani, an evergreen classic, really needs no introduction. <em>It's aromatic, it's heavenly and one of the most loved delicacies not just in India but across the globe.</em> It is believed that Mughals were the first to introduce biryani in North India whereas South India was exposed to its brilliance through the Arabs. Biryani flourished in some of the notable Muslim centres throughout the country - including Lucknow, old Delhi and Hyderabad, to name a few - after which it was gradually embraced by all.

        Here are the list of ingredients required to make biryani.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fried Onions: Also called birista</li>
        <li>Tomato Puree: Used in the marinade for flavour and body</li>
        <li>Ginger Garlic Paste: Simply ground ginger and garlic, I recommend making this at home, but if you are in a hurry, store bought works too</li>
        <li>Whole Spices: Bay leaf, Cloves, Green Cardamom and Saffron (kesar for that distinct orange colour) - these form the flavour base and give biryani that distinct fragrance that wafts up as soon as you open the pot</li>
        <li>Ground Spices: Red Chilli Powder (sub with a mix of paprika and cayenne if living outside India), turmeric powder and garam masala powder</li>
        <li>Herbs: Fresh mint and coriander leaves (cilantro) are essential to making biryani. They add freshness and bring the rice and chicken togethe</li>
        <li>Fat & Dairy: Both oil and ghee. You can choose to only use ghee but in my opinion, it makes the biryani even richer.</li>
        <li>Basmati Rice: This is a key ingredient in most biryani recipes, even the ones outside India like the Pakistani biryani and Afghani biryani.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        Here are the steps to make bryani:-
        <li>Step 1: Prepare the chicken curry.
            Prepare the biryani masala (or use store-bought) and marinate the chicken.
            
            Cook the chicken curry. While it’s cooking over low heat, prepare the rice. </li>
        <li>Step 2: Parboil the rice.
            Bring a pot of water to a boil and parboil the rice. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Bring it all together for a final steam (‘dum‘).
            Layer half of the rice, all of the chicken, and then the remaining rice on top. Add the finishing touches.
            
            Allow steam to develop, then lower the heat and let the flavors meld.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Voila serve on a thali , and enjoy ;)</p>
